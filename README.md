# Visualizing-KNN-SVM-and-XGBoost-on-the-Iris-Dataset

Each of the following algorithms has its strengths and weaknesses, and their suitability depends on the nature of the data and the specific problem being addressed in machine learning tasks.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):

Concept: KNN is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It works based on the principle of similarity, where new data points are classified by comparing them to the majority class of their nearest neighbors in the feature space.

Working: The algorithm identifies the k-nearest neighbors to a given data point based on a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance). For classification, it assigns the most common class among the k neighbors to the new data point. For regression, it computes the average or weighted average of the target values of the k neighbors.

Parameters: The crucial parameter is 'k,' which determines the number of neighbors considered during classification or regression. Choosing an appropriate 'k' value is essential for the model's performance.

Support Vector Machines (SVM):

Concept: SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It finds an optimal hyperplane that best separates data points of different classes in a high-dimensional space. For non-linearly separable data, it uses a technique called the kernel trick to map data into a higher-dimensional space where separation is possible.

Working: SVM aims to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin (distance) between the closest data points of different classes. It transforms the data into a higher-dimensional space and finds the hyperplane with the largest margin while minimizing classification errors.

Parameters: Parameters include the choice of kernel (linear, polynomial, radial basis function, etc.), regularization parameter, and kernel-specific parameters.

XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting):

Concept: XGBoost is an ensemble learning technique based on decision trees and gradient boosting. It's highly efficient and widely used in machine learning competitions and real-world applications due to its performance and scalability.

Working: XGBoost builds a series of decision trees sequentially, each one correcting errors made by the previous trees. It minimizes a loss function by adding new trees that predict the residual errors or gradients of the previous trees, hence the term "gradient boosting."

Advantages: It's efficient, handles missing values well, includes regularization to prevent overfitting, and provides flexibility in defining custom objective functions and evaluation criteria.

Parameters: Parameters include the number of trees (boosting rounds), maximum depth of trees, learning rate (shrinkage), subsample ratio, and regularization parameters.
